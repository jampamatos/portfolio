This file serves as a guide and checklist for the development of the Windows 3.11-inspired portfolio. Follow the steps below to ensure everything is organized and completed systematically.

---

## **Setup and Initial Organization**

- [X] Create the project directory: `win311-portfolio`.
- [X] Initialize a Git repository in the project directory.
- [X] Create an empty GitHub repository and link it to the local project.
- [X] Set up GitHub Projects (Kanban board) for task management.
- [X] Install Docker and Docker Compose on the development machine.
- [X] Set up WSL with all necessary dependencies:
  - [X] Node.js and npm.
  - [X] Docker.
  - [X] Editor integration (e.g., VS Code).
- [X] Add `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules`, Docker files).

## **Containerization**

### **Docker**

- [X] Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the development environment.
- [X] Add a `docker-compose.yml` for easier management.
- [X] Test the containerized environment locally.

---

## **Backlog Creation**

- [X] Create the initial backlog in GitHub Projects.
  - **To Do**:

  - [ ] `CONTACT` (links to email, LinkedIn, and GitHub).
  - [ ] Easter eggs: `MATRIX`, `RICKROLL`, etc.
